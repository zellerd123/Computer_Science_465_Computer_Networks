# Computer_Science_465_Computer_Networks
This is an actively updating repository for Computer Networks, a class currently being taken in Spring 2024

This repository is dedicated to my ongoing coursework and projects for the Computer Science 465: Computer Networks course. The course delves into the foundational and advanced concepts of computer networking, covering the protocols, architectures, and technologies that underpin modern networks. As the course progresses, I'll be updating this repository with new projects and notes.
#
**Course Overview**
Computer Science 465 offers a comprehensive study of computer networks, including:

Networking Principles: Basics of network design, protocols, and models (OSI, TCP/IP).

Data Communication: Techniques and media for data transmission, understanding network topologies.

Protocols in Depth: Detailed study of essential internet protocols like TCP, UDP, IP, and application layer protocols.

Routing and Switching: Concepts of routing algorithms, switch operations, and practical network design considerations.

Security in Networks: Introduction to the principles of network security, encryption methods, and secure protocols.

Emerging Network Technologies: Overview of current trends and technologies in networking, such as IoT, 5G, and cloud networking.

#
**Projects (Planned and Completed)**

Below are the projects planned for this course, with updates to follow as they are completed:

Project 1: Create an HTTP Proxy
Objective: Create a proxy that acts as an intermediary between web clients and web servers
Tools Used: Wireshark and other packet analysis tools.


Language: Python is the primary language for project implementations and simulations.
Analysis Tools: Wireshark for packet analysis, along with other networking tools for various projects.
Simulation Software: Use of network simulation tools for designing and testing network models.
